        "story_p2": "The name Yusei (勇誠) reflects our philosophy — courage and sincerity in every stitch. We don't rush. We don't cut corners. We let the leather speak.",
        "philosophy_title": "Philosophy",
        "philosophy_p1": "We believe in slow making. In an age of disposable goods, we choose to create objects that develop character over years of use.",

        "leather_title": "Full-Grain Leather",
        "leather_p1": "Full-grain is the strongest, most durable grade of leather. It uses the entire outer surface of the hide — including all natural grain patterns, scars, and markings that make each piece unique.",
        "leather_p2": "Unlike corrected-grain or bonded leather, full-grain develops a rich patina over time, becoming more beautiful with age rather than deteriorating.",
        "tanning_title": "Vegetable Tanning",
        "tanning_p1": "Our leather is vegetable-tanned using natural tree bark extracts — a process that takes weeks rather than the hours required by chrome tanning. The result is a firmer, more characterful leather that ages gracefully.",
        "tanning_p2": "Vegetable-tanned leather is environmentally gentler and produces earth-tone colors that deepen naturally over time.",
        "patina_title": "Patina & Aging",
        "patina_p1": "Patina is the gradual darkening and softening of leather through handling, sunlight, and natural oils. It is the signature of genuine, well-used leather.",
        "patina_p2": "Each piece begins lighter and develops its own unique character. No two pieces age the same way — your leather becomes truly yours.",
        "stitch_title": "Hand Saddle-Stitching",
        "stitch_p1": "Unlike machine stitching which uses a single thread in a chain pattern, saddle-stitching uses two needles passing through the same hole in opposite directions.",
        "stitch_p2": "If one stitch breaks, the surrounding stitches hold fast. Machine stitching unravels. This is slower — but it lasts a lifetime.",
        "edge_title": "Edge Finishing",
        "edge_p1": "Every edge is burnished by hand using multiple rounds of sanding, application of gum tragacanth, and heat burnishing. The result is a smooth, sealed edge that resists moisture and wear.",
        "hardware_title": "Hardware",
        "hardware_p1": "We use solid brass hardware — buckles, rivets, and clasps that develop their own patina alongside the leather. No plated metals. No plastic components.",
        "care_title": "Leather Care",
        "care_p1": "Full-grain leather requires minimal care. Keep it dry, avoid prolonged direct sunlight, and condition occasionally with a quality leather balm. Allow dust and dirt to be wiped away with a soft cloth.",
        "care_p2": "Do not use chemical cleaners or waterproofing sprays. The leather will naturally develop water resistance over time."
